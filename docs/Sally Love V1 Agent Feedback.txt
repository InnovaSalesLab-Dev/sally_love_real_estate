Executive Summary
The Voice AI agent demonstrated strong core functionality in property lookup and lead data collection. However, the team identified several areas for improvement regarding tonality, latency, and conversational flow to ensure the agent feels high-end and "human-centric" for Sally Love Real Estate.
________________


1. Voice & Personality Adjustments
* Tone Shift: The current voice is too "matter-of-fact." It needs a "lighter tilt" and should be more upbeat and enthusiastic.
* "Pizzazz" in Descriptions: Instead of just reading data, the AI should use a "flair" for property highlights (e.g., "This has a fantastic water view!").
* Acronym Handling: The agent struggled with "ASAP," pronouncing it as an acronym. It should be programmed to say "as soon as possible" or "A-S-A-P" naturally.
* Ending the Call: The current exit is too abrupt ("cold"). It needs a warmer, more professional closing.

2. Conversational Logic & Flow
* Breadcrumbing: When a property is found, the agent should explicitly offer to read the description before jumping to a transfer.
   * Example: "I can connect you to the agent, or if you'd like to hear a bit more, I can read you the property description. Which would you prefer?"
* Clarifying Questions (The "Golf Cart" Rule): In specific markets like The Villages, the AI needs to clarify ambiguous features. If a user asks for a "golf cart garage," the AI should explain that some listings mean "room for a cart" while others mean a dedicated garage, then offer to let an agent clarify.
* Information Chunking: When presenting multiple listings (e.g., 5 properties), the AI should provide a high-level summary first and ask where to start (e.g., "by price" or "one by one") rather than reading them all at once.

3. Technical Fixes for Developers
* Latency: There is a noticeable delay in API calls when fetching property data. This needs to be streamlined to reduce "dead air."
* Number Formatting: The agent is currently "clunky" when reading large numbers (e.g., "249,000" and "418,000"). These should be read in a more natural currency format.
* Call Forwarding Error: Resolve the Eastern European language error message that occurs when a phone number is not set up for forwarding.
* Address Verification: Ensure the AI doesn't get stuck in a loop asking for a zip code if it has already been provided or inferred.
